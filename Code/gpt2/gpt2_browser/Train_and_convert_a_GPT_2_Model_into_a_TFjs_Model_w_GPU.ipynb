        "This Colabatory builds on Max's work to retrain an advanced text generating neural network on any text dataset using `gpt-2-simple`. He built this in a way that is free on a GPU. I adapted his work to transform the model that you generate into a tensorflow js model. While I was able to load and run the model in a browser, I didn't know how to input my values or interpret the output values. You can find the details on my work in [this blog post](https://blog.fbalashov.com/2021/02/a-gpt-2-model-on-browser-close-but-no.html). Hopefully someone can continue the effort!
